\subsection{Fish abbreviations}

\say{%
  \fish{abbr} manages abbreviations - user-defined words that are replaced with
  longer phrases after they are entered.

  For example, a frequently-run command like \fish{git checkout} can be
  abbreviated to \fish{gco}. After entering \fish{gco} and pressing
  \texttt{Space} or \texttt{Enter}, the full text \fish{git checkout} will
  appear in the command line.%

\newthought{\hrefootnote{https://github.com/yurrriq/naal}{naal} is cool and all, but...}

... it's a bad habit too. the \fish{aal} abbeviation makes being not so sneaky a
bit less annoying.

<<AWS Azure login abbreviation>>=
aal = "aws-azure-login --no-prompt";

\newthought{\fish{kubectl} is very cumbersome} to type all the time.
Using fish abbrevations, save some precious keystrokes.
It's definitely \href{https://xkcd.com/1205/}{worth the time}.

<<Kubernetes fish abbreviations>>=
kc = "kubectl";
kcd = "kubectl drain --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets";
kcnp = "kubectl get pods --field-selector=spec.nodeName=";
kcx = "kubectl --context";
kg = "kubectl get";
kgy = "kubectl get -o yaml";
kn = "kubens";
kns = "kubens";
krr = "kubectl rollout restart";
krs = "kubectl rollout status";
kt = "stern";
kx = "kubectx";

\newthought{It's useful to run \fish{nix build}} with various flags.
Why not save some keystrokes for those tasks, too?

<<Nix fish abbreviations>>=
nb = "nix build";
nbd = "nix build --dry-run";
nbn = "nix build --no-link";
nbo = "nix build -o";
@

\newthought{I'm not quite used to} all the \fish{ripgrep} flags yet.
I'm also a lazy typist, so define some memorable abbreviations.

\say{%
  Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase.
  Search case sensitively otherwise.%
